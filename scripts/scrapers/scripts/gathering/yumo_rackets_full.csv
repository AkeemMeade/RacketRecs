Yonex ASTROX 100 ZZ [Dark Navy],$900.00 CAD,https://yumo.ca/collections/badminton-rackets/products/yonex-astrox-100-zz-badminton-racket,"More precise weight distribution throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint increases the rotational power. These enhancements ensure the momentum for quicker consecutive shots. Namd *1 , which produces more flex and a faster snapback, is used throughout the frame and shaft, unleashing dramatic steep power. The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks. The already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft *2 to date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback. The original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.
