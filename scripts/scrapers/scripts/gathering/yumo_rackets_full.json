The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks. The already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft *2 to date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback. The original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.

These enhancements ensure the momentum for quicker consecutive shots.

The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks. The already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft *2 to date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback. The original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.

The brand new ASTROX 77 is different -- power is effortless and accessible to all. The new ASTROX 77 is designed with a mid-flex shaft and a maneuverable, slightly heavy head which grants extra power for a wide range of players from intermediate to advanced. This second-generation sports improvements in the hitting feel by enhancing shock absorption, and in power by balancing snapback and flex. The racquet will hit store shelves worldwide in late October. The original ASTROX 77 is designed for intermediate to advanced players looking to dominate the court with steep smashes. It is equipped with the Rotational Generator System that enables quick recovery for a continuous stream of powerful attacks. The racquet utilizes NamdTM throughout the shaft producing more flex and a faster snapback. The new ASTROX 77 is a further evolved version of its predecessor, featuring new technologies for better performances and a 2.9% increase in smash power. The joint at the bottom of the frame is composed of a new resin material, Flex Fuse, which combines a shock-absorbing material with base resin for a softer feel on impact. The new elongated shaft is equipped with NamdTM, a carbon-graphite material that generates quick snapback to accompany the extra flex. The addition of the E.B.CAP PLUS (Energy Boost Cap Plus) is used for further snapback. The new ASTROX 77 will be seen in the hands of Tokyo Olympic Gold Medalist, Chen Yu Fei (CHN), World Tour Finals 2021 champion, An Se Young (KOR), 2022 World Championships mixed doubles winner, Huang Ya Qiong (CHN), and 2022 Malaysia Masters champion, Fajar Alfian (INA).
