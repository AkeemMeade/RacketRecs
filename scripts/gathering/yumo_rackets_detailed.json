Traditional racket design features unpredictable airflow that causes twisting around the Racket frame & grommets. The new frame design reduces the air drag to ensure unidirectional motion & optimises airflow over the frame, drastically increasing the athlete's swing acceleration and top speed.\nHyperlight Carbon Fiber\nThe racket frames are manufactured with rigorous procedures to ensure graphite optimisation. This process results in hyperlight carbon fiber where the atoms are bound together without any breaks creating a resistance 50 times stronger than steel. This gives you the material benefit of extra strength while playing. Also, the microscopically sized bonds ensure the racket is lighter, helping make those sharper turns.",

ISOMETRIC\nTM\nis a Trademark of Yonex CO., LTD.\n*Tested by Yonex\nBox Frame\nThe extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.\nTOKYO, Japan – The acclaimed\nARCSABER series\ndesigned for control adds to its line up with the brand new reimagined ARCSABER 7, allowing for further flight trajectory. The new ARCSABER 7 is designed for optimal flex and torque to improve precision targeting for intermediate and advanced players. Taking control of the court can come in all different forms, and for the ARCSABER, it comes from the extra few milliseconds of shuttle contact time allowing assertive, precise shot-making. This new addition will see courts in late August 2022.\nThe ARCSABER series holds a unique positioning in the Yonex racquet line-up as a series defined by shuttle-hold. In 2007 when the series was first released, the ARCSABER 7 came at a time when repulsion-based racquets were the standard. Today, after years of research and development, shuttle-hold has become a key ingredient in providing confidence for an athlete and their shuttle control.\nThe new ARCSABER 7 is enhanced with the development concept of\n“Hold for flight”\n. Analysis of the previous model showed potential for improvement by increasing frame stability while increasing shuttle contact time.\nFrame stability is improved with a frame structure unique to the ARCSABER series that has a stiff build at the top and bottom of the face, reducing unwanted distortion at impact. To extend shuttle contact time, the sides of the frame, unlike the top and bottom, are softer allowing flexibility around the sweet spot. The shaft in the ARCSABER 7 has also been redesigned for torque allowance. Upon impact, the shaft twists generating high repulsion.\nThe POCKETING BOOSTER is lined within the sides of the frame. This inner lining is a proprietary rubber-like material that brings additional elasticity to the frame’s flex increasing both shuttle hold and shuttle launch speed.\nThe new ARCSABER 7 will be seen in the hands of Tokyo Olympic Gold Medalist in mixed doubles,\nHuang Dong Ping\n(CHN), Thailand’s No. 1 women’s doubles\nRawinda Prajongjai\nand\nJongkolphan Kititharakul\n(THA), and many other elite players on tour. The racquets are scheduled for a global launch on August 19\nth\n, 2022 in three different models, PRO, TOUR and PLAY – each developed with the same performance concept but with variations in performance materials used.\narc saber 7 play | arcsaber7 plau | arc7 play | arcsabre |\narcsaber\n| 尤尼克斯 | 弓剑系列 | ARC | badminton racket | arc7 |\nARC7-P | arcsaber7 p | arc7p | arc7p | arc 7 p | arc 7 play | 2022  | grey | gray | yellow | ARCS7PS | ARC7-PLGE\nSave",

The new ARCSABER 7 is designed for optimal flex and torque to improve precision targeting for intermediate and advanced players. Taking control of the court can come in all different forms, and for the ARCSABER, it comes from the extra few milliseconds of shuttle contact time allowing assertive, precise shot-making. This new addition will see courts in late August 2022.\nThe ARCSABER series holds a unique positioning in the Yonex racquet line-up as a series defined by shuttle-hold. In 2007 when the series was first released, the ARCSABER 7 came at a time when repulsion-based racquets were the standard. Today, after years of research and development, shuttle-hold has become a key ingredient in providing confidence for an athlete and their shuttle control.\nThe new ARCSABER 7 is enhanced with the development concept of\n“Hold for flight”\n. Analysis of the previous model showed potential for improvement by increasing frame stability while increasing shuttle contact time.\nFrame stability is improved with a frame structure unique to the ARCSABER series that has a stiff build at the top and bottom of the face, reducing unwanted distortion at impact. To extend shuttle contact time, the sides of the frame, unlike the top and bottom, are softer allowing flexibility around the sweet spot. The shaft in the ARCSABER 7 has also been redesigned for torque allowance. Upon impact, the shaft twists generating high repulsion.\nThe POCKETING BOOSTER is lined within the sides of the frame. This inner lining is a proprietary rubber-like material that brings additional elasticity to the frame’s flex increasing both shuttle hold and shuttle launch speed.\nThe new ARCSABER 7 will be seen in the hands of Tokyo Olympic Gold Medalist in mixed doubles,\nHuang Dong Ping\n(CHN), Thailand’s No. 1 women’s doubles\nRawinda Prajongjai\nand\nJongkolphan Kititharakul\n(THA), and many other elite players on tour. The racquets are scheduled for a global launch on August 19\nth\n, 2022 in three different models, PRO, TOUR and PLAY – each developed with the same performance concept but with variations in performance materials used.\narc saber 7 tour | arcsaber7 tour | arc7 tour | arcsabre |\narcsaber\n| 尤尼克斯 | 弓剑系列 | ARC | badminton racket | arc7 |\nARC7-T | arcsaber7 t | arc7t | arc7t | arc 7 t | arc 7 tour | 2022   | grey | gray | yellow | ARCS7TS | ARC7-TGE |\nSave",

    "description": "Victor Auraspeed 100X H Unstrung Badminton Racket [Gray]\nVICTOR welcomes the latest addition to the AURASPEED series—\nARS-100X\n. With a suffix of X, this all-round flagship Speed racket focuses more on the continuity between each shot.\nARS-100X\nperfectly combines the technical features of AURASPEED series with the innovative shaft technology, making it silent yet aggressive.\nProduct Description\nWeight / Grip Size\n3U / G5\n4U / G5\nString tension LBS\n3U:≤29 lbs(13Kg)\n4U:≤28 lbs(12.5Kg)\nFrame Material\nHigh Resilience Modulus Graphite+Nano Fortify TR＋\nShaft Material\nHigh Resilience Modulus Graphite+PYROFIL+6.8 SHAFT\nMade in Taiwan\nProduct Details\nThe Shaft Recovery System built in ARS-100X is VICTOR’s latest technology in 2021. It uses high-modulus carbon fiber, to help the shaft release its elasticity and recover faster, with recovery ability improved by 3% and force transmission improved by 4%. The perfect integration with the FREE CORE technology not only facilitates smooth and fast swings, but also delivers a comfortable, stable, yet powerful hitting experience—helping you take down the opponent and win!\nSince the introduction of VICTOR Anti-Torsion System in THRUSTER F, the hitting feedback brought by the highly anti-torsion shaft has received wide acclaim. ARS-100X, the all-round flagship Speed racket, further integrates the VICTOR Anti-Torsion System with the high tensile strength and lightweight PYROFIL carbon fiber to achieve easy defense, agile adjustment of shuttle's course, and speedy change from defense to attack.\nProduct Technologies\nPYROFIL\nPYROFIL carbon fiber and its composites, are advanced high-performance material from Japan.  The characteristic of high intensity bonds ultra-light offers racket excellent shock-absorption and enhances control.\nSEVENTYSIX\nThe single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life.\nNANO FORTY TR\nBuilt on the strengths of the NANO FORTIFY TR, the NANO FORTIFY TR+ is engineered with an advanced, more durable carbon-fiber that is firm but offers pleasing resilience and hand-feel\nANTI-TORSION SYSTEM\nThe shaft is key to power transmission, and that's why VICTOR has been committed to developing better shafts.  Through the combination of highly resilient materials and innovative design, VICTOR has created the best shaft ever with incredible anti-torsion performance and resilience.\nSONIC REGOUND TECHNOLOGY\nThe Sonic Rebound Technology integrates Rebound Transition Construction and a high-resilience carbon fiber material, maximizing the rebound effect upon impact to help you strike with that extra speed like you never experienced before.\nDYNAMIC-SWORD\nBased on the principles of aerodynamics, the DYNAMIC-SWORD is further upgraded from the SWORD b adjusting different positions on the frame accordingly: 12  and 6 o'clock positions are made inward; 3 and 9 o'clock positions are made outward.  The blade-like frame structure has a larger sectional area to direct airflow, making returns faster and smoother.\nREBOUND SHIELD\nIntroducing highlight resilient and durable glass fiber into the multilayered design of the frame to provide better elasticity and comfort during hitting.\nFREE CORE\nDesigned by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionized handle style allows the shaft to move more freely, which can not only make swings smoother but also improve overall handling experience.\nSRS\nThe recovery performance enhanced by high modulus material unleashes the shaft's elasticity potential and creates fast rebound.\nPOWERRING\nThe integrated force of the shaft and FREECORE creates a sturdy handling and phenomenal elasticity.\nAuraspeed 100X H | Auraspeed | auraspeed100 | auraspeed100x | ars-100x h | ars100x  | badminton racket | 勝利 | 突擊 | Victor | grey | 2022",

    "description": "Victor Auraspeed Hypersonic B Unstrung Badminton Racket [ARS-HS]\nAs badminton sport and racket technology evolve, the pace of the game has gone up significantly and thus makes speed the key to victory. With this in mind, VICTOR is now launching the ultra speedy racket AURASPEED HYPERSONIC (ARS-HS) to rocket you through the sky at astounding speed!\nProduct Description\nWeight / Grip Size\n3U / G5\n4U / G5\nString tension LBS\n3U:≤29 lbs(13Kg)\n4U:≤28 lbs(12.5Kg)\nFrame Material\nHigh ResilienceModulus Graphite+Nano Fortify SR+HARD CORED TECHNOLOGY\nShaft Material\nHigh ResilienceModulus Graphite +PYROFIL+6.8SHAFT\nMade In china\nBlade-Like Thinness: Thinner and Stiffer DYNAMIC-SWORD\nARS-HS has made the classic DYNAMIC-SWORD even lighter and thinner to lower the wind resistance and enable faster hits and returns. Engineered with the innovative new material Nano Fortify SR, the frame of ARS-HS is thin, light, stiff, durable, and fatigue-resistant. The speed and elasticity of the racket has been significantly improved, making ARS-HS a racket that can provide you with both outstanding stiffness and incredible handling experience.\nForce Transmission: PYROFIL 6.8 Shaft\nThe shaft is built with the cutting-edge composite carbon fiber material PYROFIL to make the racket stiff and lightweight. With a diameter of 6.8 mm, the shaft allows for more improvement in speed and enables smooth force transmission and greater controllability.\nEnjoy the Freedom: Feel Free with FREE CORE Technology\nUnlike traditional solid wooden handles, the FREE CORE synthetic handle made with nanotechnology has an innovative hollow structure to improve shock-absorption and create more space for the shaft to flex. It not only allows for smoother hitting and better rebound, but also makes the transition from defense to attack hard for the opponent to be prepared for. The transparent cap exclusively designed by VICTOR further provides a peek into the secret of FREE CORE technology.\nTechnologies\nPYROFIL\nPYROFIL carbon fiber and its composites, are advanced high-performance material from Japan.  The characteristic of high intensity bonds ultra-light offers racket excellent shock-absorption and enhances control.\nSEVENTYSIX\nThe single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life.\nHARD CORED TECHNOLOGY\nInspired by military helicopter, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimize material size, reinforce handling feel and performance at a critical standard.\nFREE CORE\nDesigned by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionized handle style allows the shaft to move more freely, which can not only make swings smoother but also improve overall handling experience,\nCOMPOUND-SWORD\nThe compound frame design can be divided into three major parts:  The upper section is made with fan-shaped structure to lower wind resistance and accelerate each swing.  The Compound-Sword structure in the middle section is designed to lighten the filler and enable fast rebound.  Finally, the lower section is built in airfoil structure to lower wind resistance and keep excellent anti-torsion performance in a \"whipping\" style which helps to create steeper and quicker attacks with satisfying control.\nNANO FORTIFY\nThe adoption of the single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) effectively enhances racket intensity, elasticity, and fatigue resistance.  The lightweight enhanced material enables both strength and smooth handling.\nAuraspeed Hypersonic | ARSHSB | ARS HS B | ARS-HS-B | Auraspeed |   | badminton racket | 勝利 | 突擊 | Victor | 2022",

This reduces air resistance which helps to generate faster shuttlecock speeds. It’s suitable for players looking for the best control with little to no sacrifice in power.\nKeyword: CONTROL!\nSometimes controlling the badminton game is enough to win a match. You can beat a power player and edge a fast competitor just by improving the control of your shots. That’s where the Aeronaut Technology Platform from Li-Ning comes in to the\nbadminton racket\nmix. Using a unique air-stream channel integrated into the head, these badminton rackets directly reduce air resistance.\nWith less drag, you have more control over your shots and you can generate faster shuttlecock speeds. Badminton rackets built on the Aeronaut Technology platform give players more control without having to cut back on power. Don’t sacrifice power or get beat with speed – gain control over the match with these badminton rackets from Li-Ning.\nFour Types of Aeronaut Badminton Control Playing Styles\nLi-Ning realizes that players want to be in control of their shots, but that all shots are not created equal. If you are searching for a control type racket, in the Aeronaut Technology series, choose according to your strengths:\nDRIVE:\nFor fast players who can switch quickly between offense and defense these rackets feature a stiffer shaft and highly-elastic head.\nBOOST:\nFor well-rounded, experienced players these rackets are built with a moderate balance point and medium shaft.\nCOMBAT:\nFor strong, aggressive players who want to maximize their power, these rackets are designed with a heavier head and higher balance point.\nINSTINCT:\nFor players who want to combine a lightweight racket with aggressive speed and agility, these rackets have flexible shafts and weigh less than 80 grams.\nLining | Aeronaut | A9000 | Instinct | Light | 9000 | badminton | racket | AYPP124 | AYPT403-4 | AYPT403 |\nAYPT403-3",

Kento Momota. The new ASTROX 99 goes a step beyond unequivocal raw power, gaining the ability to control the pace of the game. The new ASTROX 99 will be available in late-September with a design reveal on September 1st.\nLike the ASTROX 88 S/D models, the new ASTROX 99 will be available to a wider audience with versions PRO, TOUR, GAME, and PLAY, designed and crafted with the same performance concept for different levels of play.\nThe ASTROX 99 is a head-heavy power racquet, boasting the heaviest swing weight of the ASTROX series. It’s known to generate a single, powerful smash, often too heavy to be speedy in recovery. In response, Yonex worked hand in hand with Kento Momota to craft a racquet that would give him both power and the ability to convert defensive plays into offense; the result is an improved ASTROX 99 where decisive power is accompanied by extended shuttle hold for enhanced defensive shot-making.\nThe new ASTROX 99* is equipped with the POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, a tungsten-infused weighted bumper installed at the top of the frame transferring additional weight to the shuttle for more powerful smashes. To enhance defensive shot-making, Wide Diameter Grommets are strategically placed on the frame sides, allowing strings to shift at impact for emphasized shuttle pocketing.

    "description": "Yonex ASTROX 100 ZZ Unstrung Badminton Racket [Kurenai]\nKurenai as used by Viktor Axelsen\nMore precise weight distribution throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint increases the rotational power. These enhancements ensure the momentum for quicker consecutive shots. Namd\n*1\n, which produces more flex and a faster snapback, is used throughout the frame and shaft, unleashing dramatic steep power. The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks.\nThe already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft\n*2\nto date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback.\nThe original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.\nASTROX 100 ZZ\nFor advanced players looking for immediate access to power to maintain a relentless attack\nLength: 10mm longer\nItem Code: AX100ZZ\nFlex: EXTRA STIFF\nFrame: HM Graphite / Namd / Tungsten / Black Micro Core / Nanometric\nShaft: HM Graphite / Namd\nWeight / Grip Size:\n4U (Ave.83g) G5\n3U4\nStringing Advice: 4U 20-28lbs, 3U 21-29lbs\nColour: Kurenai\nMade in: Japan\nWorld Launch: May 21, 2021\n*1 Namd is a technology developed by Nitta Corporation to “uniformly disperse carbon nanotubes into carbon fiber composites\".\n*2 Hyper Slim Shaft in ASTROX 100 ZZ\nINNOVATION\nCommon technologies throughout the ASTROX 100 series.\n1. Expanded Sweet Spot in Modified Frame\nCompared to regular round frames, Yonex’s original ISOMETRIC frame creates a wider sweet spot. The ASTROX 100 frame has been slightly modified into an even more square-like shape, increasing the already wide sweet spot by 2.9%\n*1\n, while maintaining the same overall frame size. Benefits of this evolved ISOMETRIC shape include increased power on strong and continuous shots even if they don’t hit the center of the racquet.\n2. Newly Designed Cap: E.B.CAP PLUS\nA new structure reduces shaft twisting and increases its flexibility. Thumb fitting shape transmits even more power to the shuttle.\nDifferences between the ASTROX 100 ZZ and the ASTROX 100 ZX models.\n3. Advanced Rotational Generator System\nThe new innovative Rotational Generator System precisely distributes weight to the top of the frame, joints, and the end of the racquet grip.\nIn ASTROX 100 ZZ, Black Micro Core material at the top of the frame increases rigidity by 4% and vibration absorption by 2%\n*1\n. While the use of Black Micro Core material puts more weight on the head of the frame. A new built-in T-joint, which is 1.3%\n*1\nlighter than any other Yonex racquet, allows the racquet to have a lower weight distribution. By redesigning the racquet’s weight distribution in this manner, high rotational power needed for strong continuous smashes is generated.\n4. Improved Swing-ability and Resilience: Slim Shaft\nASTROX 100 ZZ : Hyper Slim Shaft\nDesigned with the slimmest shaft in the history of Yonex racquets\n*1\n, this ASTROX model, traditionally hollow inside, uses graphite material in the core, resulting in an 11.8%\n*1\nreduction in air resistance. By making the shaft solid, resilience is increased, further allowing strong continuous shots.\nASTROX 100 ZX: Extra Slim and Rexis Shaft\nRexis is a high-performance shaft precisely designed through an advanced molding technique with High-Quality, ingenuitive, Performance Graphite material. It has surpassed Yonex’s quality standards.\n5.\nRevolutionary New Graphite Namd\nBy utilizing high quality Namd graphite throughout the shaft and frame of both models more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.\nViktor AXELSEN (Denmark), CHOU Tien Chen (Taiwan), Akane YAMAGUCHI (Japan) and other #TeamYonex athletes will make their debut using the new ASTROX 100 ZZ during the 2020 season.\nYonex | 2021 | astrox | intermediate | advanced | new | badminton | racket | racquet | astrox100zz | 100zz | astrox 100 zz | 100 zz  | Kurenai  | AX100ZZ |\n尤尼克斯 | ASTROX100ZZF",

ASTROX 88 S PRO and ASTROX 88 D PRO are designed to complement the evolving, faster style of doubles play, which requires even faster takebacks for continuous powerful attack shots. The release of the PRO will be accompanied by affordable models ASTROX 88S/D TOUR and GAME, designed and crafted with the same performance concept.\nNew advancements are made through the introduction of the\nVOLUME CUT RESIN\n, a groundbreaking resin that provides powerful adhesion with less material and weight. This resin is highly versatile in that it can increase durability and strength or reduce weight without compromising strength.\nThe ASTROX series are distinguished by the\nRotational Generator System\n, our intricate weight distribution technology designed with the counterbalance theory that allows head-heavy racquets to recover faster between shots. By employing the VOLUME CUT RESIN, the new 88 S/D models have a further refined Rotational Generator System where intricate weight distribution can be taken to the next level.\nImprovements*1 from the VOLUME CUT RESIN can also be seen in the frame and grommets.  The frame structure is evolved with a larger sweet spot made possible by the strength-reinforced Isometric head shape. The grommets are improved with a new pattern that uses larger, strategically-placed grommets, a technology that allows more string movement at impact and ultimately increasing shuttle hold for assertive shot-making. The 88 S models, designed for front-court players, will have longer shuttle hold for precise net control and the 88 D models, designed for back-court players, will balance repulsion and shuttle hold for maximum power.\nThe ASTROX 88 S PRO and ASTROX 88 D PRO are set to debut on court in March by players such as men’s doubles world no.1 Kevin S. Sukamuljo and Marcus F. Gideon, and women’s doubles world no. 2 Yuki Fukushima and Sayaka Hirota*2.\n*1 Some technologies are not applied to the TOUR or GAME models.\n*2 BWF World Ranking as of Jan. 5, 2021.\nSeries Overview\nIntroducing the new ASTROX 88 D racquet with Rotational Generator System. The counter balanced head adapts to each shot, helping you to control the drive and attack the opposition with increased acceleration, steeper angle and power on the smash.\nProduct Technology\nNew Frame Design and Racket Length\nMaking the whole frame flexible allows the“ASTROX 88 S”to hold the shuttlecock for accurate control, while the“ASTROX 88 D” has more flex in the upper part of the frame transmitting maximum power to the shuttlecock to break through the opponents. In addition the overall length of the“88 S” is only 5mm longer, which enhances both accuracy and power while the“88 D” is 10 mm longer to provide powerful attacks.\nNANOMETRIC\nNANOMETRIC* improves the bonding strength between the carbon fibres enabling us to take racquet shaft construction to another level. By reducing the amount of carbon in the shaft to make it 60%* thinner than a conventional racquet whilst retaining stiffness, YONEX has created a revolutionary lightweight racquet with lightening head speed and control.\n*NANOMETRIC is the new material which applies the NANOALLOY\nTM\nTechnology of Toray Industries, Inc.\nISOMETRIC\nThe square-shaped ISOMETRIC frame shape is designed to keep vertical strings at a similar length, as well as the horizontal strings to produce an expanded sweet spot in all directions.\nNEW Grommet Pattern\nThe single-pass grommet hole construction provides more grommet holes for a more high-performance stringing pattern.\nSOLID FEEL CORE\nThe built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact. Solid feel core is carried in all racquets manufactured in Japan.\nAERO+BOX Frame\nCombines solid hitting feel and quick swing.\nNEW Built-in T-Joint\n‘NEW’ Built-in T-Joint is manufactured from a special lightweight plastic combined with epoxy resin and foaming agent that enhances quality and performance by increasing the stability of the shuttle on the string bed and through the air.\nNEW Energy Boost Cap\nThe new shape allows the shaft to flex, which ensures the maximum effect of “Namd\n[1]\n(more flex and faster kick-back graphite material)” and stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft twisting, increasing control\nYonex | 2021 | astrox | intermediate | advanced | new | badminton | racket | racquet | astrox88d | astrox88dpro | 88d pro | 88 d pro | 88d | 88 d | camel gold  | AX88D-P | ASTROX88DPF",

These enhancements ensure the momentum for quicker consecutive shots. Namd\n*1\n, which produces more flex and a faster snapback, is used throughout the frame and shaft, unleashing dramatic steep power. The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks.\nThe already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft\n*2\nto date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback.\nThe original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.\nASTROX 100 ZZ\nLength: 10mm longer\nItem Code: AX100ZZ\nFlex: EXTRA STIFF\nFrame: HM Graphite / Namd / Tungsten / Black Micro Core / Nanometric\nShaft: HM Graphite / Namd\nWeight / Grip Size:\n4U (Ave.83g) G5\n3U4\nStringing Advice: 4U 20-28lbs, 3U 21-29lbs\nColour: Dark Navy\nMade in: Japan\nRelease date\nMarch 20\nth\n, 2020\n*1 Namd is a technology developed by Nitta Corporation to “uniformly disperse carbon nanotubes into carbon fiber composites\".\n*2 Hyper Slim Shaft in ASTROX 100 ZZ\nINNOVATION\nCommon technologies throughout the ASTROX 100 series.\n1. Expanded Sweet Spot in Modified Frame\nCompared to regular round frames, Yonex’s original ISOMETRIC frame creates a wider sweet spot. The ASTROX 100 frame has been slightly modified into an even more square-like shape, increasing the already wide sweet spot by 2.9%\n*1\n, while maintaining the same overall frame size. Benefits of this evolved ISOMETRIC shape include increased power on strong and continuous shots even if they don’t hit the center of the racquet.\n2. Newly Designed Cap: E.B.CAP PLUS\nA new structure reduces shaft twisting and increases its flexibility. Thumb fitting shape transmits even more power to the shuttle.\nDifferences between the ASTROX 100 ZZ and the ASTROX 100 ZX models.\n3. Advanced Rotational Generator System\nThe new innovative Rotational Generator System precisely distributes weight to the top of the frame, joints, and the end of the racquet grip.\nIn ASTROX 100 ZZ, Black Micro Core material at the top of the frame increases rigidity by 4% and vibration absorption by 2%\n*1\n. While the use of Black Micro Core material puts more weight on the head of the frame. A new built-in T-joint, which is 1.3%\n*1\nlighter than any other Yonex racquet, allows the racquet to have a lower weight distribution. By redesigning the racquet’s weight distribution in this manner, high rotational power needed for strong continuous smashes is generated.\n4. Improved Swing-ability and Resilience: Slim Shaft\nASTROX 100 ZZ : Hyper Slim Shaft\nDesigned with the slimmest shaft in the history of Yonex racquets\n*1\n, this ASTROX model, traditionally hollow inside, uses graphite material in the core, resulting in an 11.8%\n*1\nreduction in air resistance. By making the shaft solid, resilience is increased, further allowing strong continuous shots.\nASTROX 100 ZX: Extra Slim and Rexis Shaft\nRexis is a high-performance shaft precisely designed through an advanced molding technique with High-Quality, ingenuitive, Performance Graphite material. It has surpassed Yonex’s quality standards.\n5.\nRevolutionary New Graphite Namd\nBy utilizing high quality Namd graphite throughout the shaft and frame of both models more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.\nViktor AXELSEN (Denmark), CHOU Tien Chen (Taiwan), Akane YAMAGUCHI (Japan) and other #TeamYonex athletes will make their debut using the new ASTROX 100 ZZ during the 2020 season.\nastrox100zz | astrox 100zz | astrox 100 zz",

    "description": "Li-Ning 3D Calibar-600B badminton Racket\nThe 3D CALIBAR 600B badminton racket is built on the 3D Calibar Technology Platform and features a high-tech, geometric badminton racket frame design that greatly reduces air resistance. It produces faster swing speeds for bigger smashes and gains outstanding reviews from strong players that are looking for maximum power.\nLi-Ning BOOST Series badminton rackets feature moderate balance point and a medium shaft making them suitable for well-rounded and experienced players.\nThe 3D Calibar Technology Platform uses a 3-digit numbering system.The first digit determines the grade of the racket as follows:\nIf the first digit is 1, 2 or 3, the racket is suitable for beginners.\nIf the first digit is 4, 5 or 6, the racket is suitable for intermediate players.\nIf the first digit is 7, 8 or 9, the racket is suitable for advanced players.\nStrings not included. Please see Available Options above for professional stringing services performed on a cutting edge Li-Ning electronic stringing machine using your choice of best-in-class Li-Ning badminton strings.\nBADMINTON RACKET TECHNOLOGIES:\nWING STABILZER\nIntroducing aviation technology to control the racket frame. After impact, Li-Ning rackets absorb unnecessary shaking from vibrations and restore the racket’s outer “wings” back to a precision performance mode. This readies the player for a quick, precise and stable follow up stroke.\nMPCF REINFORCING TECHNOLOGY\nLi-Ning takes the extra step to avoid imperfections sometimes caused by machine processing of other rackets. By implementing multi-layer carbon fibers, the racket is crafted with strength and longevity in mind.\nDYNAMIC-OPTIMUM FRAME\nDLi-Ning rackets are manufactured with a sweet spot that extends upward. The hitting point is moved higher, providing a larger defensive area. This considerably improves hitting velocity due to a wider stringed area and increased bounce strength.\nAEROTEC-BEAM SYSTEM\nImplementing real data compiled from the field, Li-Ning manufactures the most aerodynamic rackets possible. Advanced calculations have resulted in rackets with extremely low drag and higher intensity.\nTB NANO\nThe nanometer technology combines the carbon fiber and resin more closely. This method provides better elasticity, stability and durability – resulting in more powerful striking.\nHIGH TENSILE SLIM SHAFT\nYour shot placement will be more accurate with this Li-Ning 7.0 mm diameter slim shaft design. This craftsmanship helps balance the power of rebounds by channeling it into your torsion performance.\nBADMINTON RACKET SPECIFICATIONS:\nCOLOR: Red, Grey\nMATERIAL: Commercial Grade Carbon Fiber\nWEIGHT: 85-89 grams\nGRIP SIZE: S2\nOVERALL LENGTH: 675mm\nGRIP LENGTH: 200mm\nBALANCE POINT: 290mm\nFLEX: Medium Flexible\nTENSION: Vertical 24-28 lbs, Horizontal 26-30 lbs\n*Shipping: Handling usually ships in 6-7 business days*\nli ning | 3d calibar | 600b | aypm402 | racket | badminton | 3d | calibar | grey | red | AYPT387-3 | AYPM402",

This provides optimum strength and consistent performance no matter which racket you choose.\nCUBIC LOCKING\nThese slim-grooved grommets lock in and protect the exposed portion of the string along the edges of the racket. They help provide shock absorption to make your shots even more accurate.\nSTABILIZED TORSION ANGLE\nWith a Stabilized Torsion Angle, shots that are not hit with the sweet spot of the racket are designed to act almost as if they were. This torsion resistance performance allows the frame to remain stabilized for an even hitting surface.\nFRTP TECH\nBy changing the shaft’s recoil point, our rackets quickly bend and rebound back into position, so you are ready for the continuous volley and attack.\nBADMINTON RACKET SPECIFICATIONS:\nCOLOR: Grey, Gold\nMATERIAL: Military Grade Carbon Fiber\nWEIGHT: 83 grams\nGRIP SIZE: S2\nOVERALL LENGTH: 675mm\nGRIP LENGTH: 210mm\nBALANCE POINT: 308mm\nFLEX: Medium Stiff\nTENSION: Vertical 26-30 lbs, Horizontal 28-32 lbs\n*Shipping: Handling usually ships in 6-7 business days*\nli ning | 3d calibar | 900 | aypm426 | racket | badminton | 3d | calibar | grey | gold | AYPM426-1 | AYPM426-5 | AYPT381",
