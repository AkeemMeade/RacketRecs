DYNAMIC-SWORD
Based on the principles of aerodynamics, the DYNAMIC-SWORD is further upgraded from the SWORD by adjusting different positions on the frame accordingly: 12 and 6 o’clock positions are made inward; 3 and 9 o’clock positions are made outward. The blade-like frame structure has a larger sectional area to direct airflow, making returns faster and smoother.
PBO HIGH PERFORMANCE FIBER
An aeronautical material with high-strength, and it elevates force transmission performance. This makes the racket lightweight and both strength and comfort hitting sensation are combined.
PYROFIL by Mitsubishi

Power Frame
Power frames are frames with extra wideness or extra stability on top of the racket frame. This makes the frame stronger and less flexible in this area which generates more of the energy into the stroke. This normally indicates a little more weight in the top of the frame compared to normal frames, which also helps to optimize the power.
Ultra High Modulus Graphite
This material is used to enhance the performance in our very best rackets. The ultra high modulus graphite is stronger and stiffer than ordinary graphite, creating rackets that have less torsion and more power. This will give you more accurate and powerful strokes.
Carbon Nano Tubes
Carbon Nano Tubes (CNT) is based on extraordinary small scale advancements in the material construction. FZ FORZA introduces world-class rackets manufactured using polymer composite materials modified by Multi-Wall Carbon Nano Tubes (MWCNT).
Thanks to the MWCNT technology your FZ FORZA racket has improved durability in comparison with conventional rackets. The polymer resin that binds the carbon fibers together will ensure toughness and damag e tolerance.

Product Technology:
Revolutionary Graphite
A world-first, new dimension graphite material, Namd, greatly improves the adhesion of the graphite fibers and resin by attaching nanomaterial directly to the graphite fiber.In high performance racquets, it is common to combine nanomaterials with resin that connects graphite fibers, but in Namd, nanomaterials are directly adhered to the graphite fibers and resin is greatly increased. This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and stores energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.
AERO+BOX Frame
Combines solid hitting feel and quick swing.
Enlarged Sweet Spot
ISOMETRIC
TM
technology continues to help the world’s greatest players achieve global success.
Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC
TM
design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC
TM
racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.
ISOMETRIC
TM
delivers greater control without sacrificing power. ISOMETRIC
TM
is a Trademark of Yonex CO., LTD.
*Tested by Yonex
Counterbalanced Weight Distribution
By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is distributed throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint for maximum control. The transition to the next shot can be performed smoothly, with rapid succession.
Solid Feel Core
Cuts Vibration
The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact. Solid feel core is carried in all racquets manufactured in Japan.
Super Slim Shaft
Reduced Air Resistance
The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.
Increased Control
The new shape allows the shaft to flex, which ensures the maximum effect of “Namd[1](more flex and faster kick-back graphite material)” and stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft twisting, increasing control
Vibration Dampening Mesh, VDM, is a stretchy mesh material rolled with the carbon to reduce unwanted vibrations.
This racket comes unstrung, Please choose add on strings if needed. Thank you

TOKYO, Japan Lightning strikes with the brand new NANOFLARE 1000. Uncharted speeds became reality with the realization of this new flagship racquet. The NANOFLARE 1000 is designed with the motif of a column of light, a design expressing the speed and power of a launched shuttle. The NANOFLARE 1000 is set to see a worldwide launch of June 16, 2023.
The NANOFLARE 1000 series is designed for players looking for additional shot and swing speed with agile maneuverability. The NANOFLARE 1000’s new Wide Profile Frame paired with the Sonic Flare System generates high repulsion on impact while reducing air resistance.
For more advanced players, the NANOFLARE 1000 Z and TOUR designs combine the Wide Profile Frame with an aero shape and compact frame to create the AERO COMPACT Frame. This new frame improves repulsion even further. For the advanced models, high modulus graphite materials are implemented on the top and bottom of the frame along with a SPEED-ASSIST BUMPER at the base of the frame. This reduces frame warp and improves overall repulsion performance.
The new NANOFLARE 1000 is being used on court now in the hands of Rio Olympic gold medalist, Carolina Marin (ESP), 2022 All England silver medalist, Lakshya Sen (IND), and 2022 French Open champion, He Bing Jiao (CHN).
Lightning strikes with the new NANOFLARE 1000
The racquets are scheduled for a global launch on June 16th, 2023, in four different models, Z, TOUR, GAME and PLAY – each developed with the same performance concept but with variations in materials used.

A next-generation highly strong, yet elastic carbon fiber developed by Toray Industries, Inc.
Solid Feel Core
Cuts Vibration
The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact. Solid feel core is carried in all racquets manufactured in Japan.
Max Acceleration
The revolutionary new graphite material TORAYCAR M40X and SUPER HMG provide unrivalled power and stability for maximum shuttle acceleration.
Ultra PE Fiber
The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fibre – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.
Reduced Air Resistance
The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.
Increased Control
The new shape allows the shaft to flex, which ensures the maximum effect of “Namd[1](more flex and faster kick-back graphite material)” and stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft twisting, increasing control
New Built-in T-Joint
The lightweight T-Joint increases stability of the shuttle on the strings, maximizing power and control.
EX-HMG
Provides sharper power for all your shots.
SPEED- ASSIST BUMPER
The SPEED-ASSIST BUMPER is a connected grommet containing highly rigid material that is resistant to warping. They are attached to the lower part of the frame to reduce frame warp and improve repulsion performance.
TOKYO, Japan Lightning strikes with the brand new NANOFLARE 1000. Uncharted speeds became reality with the realization of this new flagship racquet. The NANOFLARE 1000 is designed with the motif of a column of light, a design expressing the speed and power of a launched shuttle.
The NANOFLARE 1000 is set to see a worldwide launch of June 16, 2023.
The NANOFLARE 1000 series is designed for players looking for additional shot and swing speed with agile maneuverability. The NANOFLARE 1000’s new Wide Profile Frame paired with the Sonic Flare System generates high repulsion on impact while reducing air resistance.
For more advanced players, the NANOFLARE 1000 Z and TOUR designs combine the Wide Profile Frame with an aero shape and compact frame to create the AERO COMPACT Frame. This new frame improves repulsion even further. For the advanced models, high modulus graphite materials are implemented on the top and bottom of the frame along with a SPEED-ASSIST BUMPER at the base of the frame. This reduces frame warp and improves overall repulsion performance.
The new NANOFLARE 1000 is being used on court now in the hands of Rio Olympic gold medalist, Carolina Marin (ESP), 2022 All England silver medalist, Lakshya Sen (IND), and 2022 French Open champion, He Bing Jiao (CHN).
Lightning strikes with the new NANOFLARE 1000
The racquets are scheduled for a global launch on June 16th, 2023, in four different models, Z, TOUR, GAME and PLAY – each developed with the same performance concept but with variations in materials used.

The sweet spot of the SST 80G is the same distance from your hand as the sweet spot of a standard 64.5 cm racquet, so that you will use your natural swing and timing. However, the SST 80G’s head is much smaller, and the result is immediate bio-feedback if you miss the sweet spot. Heighten your concentration as you master hitting on the sweet spot every time. Go back to your usual racquet and be amazed at the improvement.

New ASTROX 77: This Power Is Ours
TOKYO, Japan – Power is an integral characteristic of the ASTROX family. For racquets in
the ASTROX line-up, the head-heavy nature of the series means strength is pertinent to
unlocking the raw power. The brand new ASTROX 77 is different -- power is effortless and accessible to all. The new ASTROX 77 is designed with a mid-flex shaft and a maneuverable, slightly heavy head which grants extra power for a wide range of players from intermediate to advanced. This second-generation sports improvements in the hitting feel by enhancing shock absorption, and in power by balancing snapback and flex. The racquet will hit store shelves worldwide in late October.
The original ASTROX 77 is designed for intermediate to advanced players looking to
dominate the court with steep smashes. It is equipped with the Rotational Generator System that enables quick recovery for a continuous stream of powerful attacks. The racquet utilizes NamdTM throughout the shaft producing more flex and a faster snapback.  The new ASTROX 77 is a further evolved version of its predecessor, featuring new technologies for better performances and a 2.9% increase in smash power. The joint at the bottom of the frame is composed of a new resin material, Flex Fuse, which combines a shock-absorbing material with base resin for a softer feel on impact. The new elongated shaft is equipped with NamdTM, a carbon-graphite material that generates quick snapback to
accompany the extra flex. The addition of the E.B.CAP PLUS (Energy Boost Cap Plus) is used for further snapback.
The new ASTROX 77 will be seen in the hands of Tokyo Olympic Gold Medalist, Chen Yu
Fei (CHN), World Tour Finals 2021 champion, An Se Young (KOR), 2022 World
Championships mixed doubles winner, Huang Ya Qiong (CHN), and 2022 Malaysia Masters champion, Fajar Alfian (INA). The racquets are scheduled for a global launch on October 21st, 2022, in three different models, PRO, TOUR and PLAY – each developed with the same performance concept but with variations in performance materials used.

Revolutionary Graphite
A world-first, new dimension graphite material, Namd, greatly improves the adhesion of the graphite fibers and resin by attaching nanomaterial directly to the graphite fiber.In high performance racquets, it is common to combine nanomaterials with resin that connects graphite fibers, but in Namd, nanomaterials are directly adhered to the graphite fibers and resin is greatly increased. This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and stores energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.

The ARCSABER frame is designed to flex at the point of impact to hold the shuttle on the string bed for longer. By storing and then releasing energy, ARCSABER delivers precise shot-making for players seeking a higher level of control. Positioned at the sides of the racquet, CS Carbon Nanotubes improve the frame’s elasticity, holding the shuttle on the string bed for enhanced control at the point of impact.

The extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.
TOKYO, Japan – The acclaimed
ARCSABER series
designed for control adds to its line up with the brand new reimagined ARCSABER 7, allowing for further flight trajectory. The new ARCSABER 7 is designed for optimal flex and torque to improve precision targeting for intermediate and advanced players. Taking control of the court can come in all different forms, and for the ARCSABER, it comes from the extra few milliseconds of shuttle contact time allowing assertive, precise shot-making. This new addition will see courts in late August 2022.
The ARCSABER series holds a unique positioning in the Yonex racquet line-up as a series defined by shuttle-hold. In 2007 when the series was first released, the ARCSABER 7 came at a time when repulsion-based racquets were the standard. Today, after years of research and development, shuttle-hold has become a key ingredient in providing confidence for an athlete and their shuttle control.
The new ARCSABER 7 is enhanced with the development concept of
“Hold for flight”
. Analysis of the previous model showed potential for improvement by increasing frame stability while increasing shuttle contact time.
Frame stability is improved with a frame structure unique to the ARCSABER series that has a stiff build at the top and bottom of the face, reducing unwanted distortion at impact. To extend shuttle contact time, the sides of the frame, unlike the top and bottom, are softer allowing flexibility around the sweet spot. The shaft in the ARCSABER 7 has also been redesigned for torque allowance. Upon impact, the shaft twists generating high repulsion.
The POCKETING BOOSTER is lined within the sides of the frame. This inner lining is a proprietary rubber-like material that brings additional elasticity to the frame’s flex increasing both shuttle hold and shuttle launch speed.
The new ARCSABER 7 will be seen in the hands of Tokyo Olympic Gold Medalist in mixed doubles,
Huang Dong Ping
(CHN), Thailand’s No. 1 women’s doubles
Rawinda Prajongjai
and
Jongkolphan Kititharakul

CONTROL is the Key Characteristic of Aeronaut Badminton Racket Technology
The Li-Ning Aeronaut Technology Platform has a unique air-stream channel integrated into the racket head. This reduces air resistance which helps to generate faster shuttlecock speeds. It’s suitable for players looking for the best control with little to no sacrifice in power.
Keyword: CONTROL!
Sometimes controlling the badminton game is enough to win a match. You can beat a power player and edge a fast competitor just by improving the control of your shots. That’s where the Aeronaut Technology Platform from Li-Ning comes in to the
badminton racket
mix. Using a unique air-stream channel integrated into the head, these badminton rackets directly reduce air resistance.
With less drag, you have more control over your shots and you can generate faster shuttlecock speeds. Badminton rackets built on the Aeronaut Technology platform give players more control without having to cut back on power. Don’t sacrifice power or get beat with speed – gain control over the match with these badminton rackets from Li-Ning.
Four Types of Aeronaut Badminton Control Playing Styles
Li-Ning realizes that players want to be in control of their shots, but that all shots are not created equal. If you are searching for a control type racket, in the Aeronaut Technology series, choose according to your strengths:
DRIVE:
For fast players who can switch quickly between offense and defense these rackets feature a stiffer shaft and highly-elastic head.
BOOST:
For well-rounded, experienced players these rackets are built with a moderate balance point and medium shaft.
COMBAT:
For strong, aggressive players who want to maximize their power, these rackets are designed with a heavier head and higher balance point.
INSTINCT:
For players who want to combine a lightweight racket with aggressive speed and agility, these rackets have flexible shafts and weigh less than 80 grams.

– The popular ASTROX 99 series known for generating dominating smash power, is coming out with new technology and a new look ― in collaboration with men’s singles World No1. Kento Momota. The new ASTROX 99 goes a step beyond unequivocal raw power, gaining the ability to control the pace of the game. The new ASTROX 99 will be available in late-September with a design reveal on September 1st.
Like the ASTROX 88 S/D models, the new ASTROX 99 will be available to a wider audience with versions PRO, TOUR, GAME, and PLAY, designed and crafted with the same performance concept for different levels of play.
The ASTROX 99 is a head-heavy power racquet, boasting the heaviest swing weight of the ASTROX series. It’s known to generate a single, powerful smash, often too heavy to be speedy in recovery. In response, Yonex worked hand in hand with Kento Momota to craft a racquet that would give him both power and the ability to convert defensive plays into offense; the result is an improved ASTROX 99 where decisive power is accompanied by extended shuttle hold for enhanced defensive shot-making.
The new ASTROX 99* is equipped with the POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, a tungsten-infused weighted bumper installed at the top of the frame transferring additional weight to the shuttle for more powerful smashes. To enhance defensive shot-making, Wide Diameter Grommets are strategically placed on the frame sides, allowing strings to shift at impact for emphasized shuttle pocketing. The iconic ISOMETRIC frame has been modified by strengthening frame corners to adjust the shape and expand the sweet spot.
INNOVATIONS
POWER-ASSIST BUMPER
Boosted power with a tungsten-infused weighted bumper, adding 55% more weight* than conventional grommets. The POWER-ASSIST BUMPER enhances the Rotational Generator System, quickly transferring more weight to the shuttle.
*Measured by Yonex
Rotational Generator System
Intricate weight distribution technology designed with the counterbalance theory that allows head-heavy racquets to recover faster between shots. By employing the VOLUME CUT RESIN and POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, the new ASTROX 99 models have a further refined Rotational Generator System where intricate weight distribution can be taken to the next level.
Wide Diameter Grommets
Control the shuttle-release timing with larger grommets designed for more string movement, extending the shuttle contact time.
Modified ISOMETRIC frame shape
The iconic ISOMETRIC head shape is enhanced for a larger, more forgiving sweet spot. Frame sides are strategically reinforced with wider areas for a stronger construct.

2021 NEW
– The popular ASTROX 99 series known for generating dominating smash power, is coming out with new technology and a new look ― in collaboration with men’s singles World No1. Kento Momota. The new ASTROX 99 goes a step beyond unequivocal raw power, gaining the ability to control the pace of the game. The new ASTROX 99 will be available in late-September with a design reveal on September 1st.
Like the ASTROX 88 S/D models, the new ASTROX 99 will be available to a wider audience with versions PRO, TOUR, GAME, and PLAY, designed and crafted with the same performance concept for different levels of play.
The ASTROX 99 is a head-heavy power racquet, boasting the heaviest swing weight of the ASTROX series. It’s known to generate a single, powerful smash, often too heavy to be speedy in recovery. In response, Yonex worked hand in hand with Kento Momota to craft a racquet that would give him both power and the ability to convert defensive plays into offense; the result is an improved ASTROX 99 where decisive power is accompanied by extended shuttle hold for enhanced defensive shot-making.
The new ASTROX 99* is equipped with the POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, a tungsten-infused weighted bumper installed at the top of the frame transferring additional weight to the shuttle for more powerful smashes. To enhance defensive shot-making, Wide Diameter Grommets are strategically placed on the frame sides, allowing strings to shift at impact for emphasized shuttle pocketing. The iconic ISOMETRIC frame has been modified by strengthening frame corners to adjust the shape and expand the sweet spot.
INNOVATIONS
POWER-ASSIST BUMPER
Boosted power with a tungsten-infused weighted bumper, adding 55% more weight* than conventional grommets. The POWER-ASSIST BUMPER enhances the Rotational Generator System, quickly transferring more weight to the shuttle.
*Measured by Yonex
Rotational Generator System
Intricate weight distribution technology designed with the counterbalance theory that allows head-heavy racquets to recover faster between shots. By employing the VOLUME CUT RESIN and POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, the new ASTROX 99 models have a further refined Rotational Generator System where intricate weight distribution can be taken to the next level.
Wide Diameter Grommets
Control the shuttle-release timing with larger grommets designed for more string movement, extending the shuttle contact time.
Modified ISOMETRIC frame shape
The iconic ISOMETRIC head shape is enhanced for a larger, more forgiving sweet spot. Frame sides are strategically reinforced with wider areas for a stronger construct.

Namd
Revolutionary Graphite
A world-first, new dimension graphite material, Namd, greatly improves the adhesion of the graphite fibers and resin by attaching nanomaterial directly to the graphite fiber.In high performance racquets, it is common to combine nanomaterials with resin that connects graphite fibers, but in Namd, nanomaterials are directly adhered to the graphite fibers and resin is greatly increased. This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and stores energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.

More precise weight distribution throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint increases the rotational power. These enhancements ensure the momentum for quicker consecutive shots. Namd
*1
, which produces more flex and a faster snapback, is used throughout the frame and shaft, unleashing dramatic steep power. The synergy created from the Rotational Generator System enables continuous powerful attacks.
The already slim shaft has been modified utilizing a high-quality graphite material, creating the slimmest shaft
*2
to date in Yonex. It provides a smoother follow-through by reducing air resistance and generates rotational power through more flex and a faster snapback.
The original ISOMETRIC frame has also evolved into a more ISOMETRIC shape, expanding the sweet spot. Designed for reduced power loss from off-center shots, the 2.9% larger sweet spot increases power.

INNOVATION
Common technologies throughout the ASTROX 100 series.
1. Expanded Sweet Spot in Modified Frame
Compared to regular round frames, Yonex’s original ISOMETRIC frame creates a wider sweet spot. The ASTROX 100 frame has been slightly modified into an even more square-like shape, increasing the already wide sweet spot by 2.9%
*1
, while maintaining the same overall frame size. Benefits of this evolved ISOMETRIC shape include increased power on strong and continuous shots even if they don’t hit the center of the racquet.
2. Newly Designed Cap: E.B.CAP PLUS
A new structure reduces shaft twisting and increases its flexibility. Thumb fitting shape transmits even more power to the shuttle.
Differences between the ASTROX 100 ZZ and the ASTROX 100 ZX models.
3. Advanced Rotational Generator System
The new innovative Rotational Generator System precisely distributes weight to the top of the frame, joints, and the end of the racquet grip.
In ASTROX 100 ZZ, Black Micro Core material at the top of the frame increases rigidity by 4% and vibration absorption by 2%
*1
. While the use of Black Micro Core material puts more weight on the head of the frame. A new built-in T-joint, which is 1.3%
*1
lighter than any other Yonex racquet, allows the racquet to have a lower weight distribution. By redesigning the racquet’s weight distribution in this manner, high rotational power needed for strong continuous smashes is generated.
4. Improved Swing-ability and Resilience: Slim Shaft
ASTROX 100 ZZ : Hyper Slim Shaft
Designed with the slimmest shaft in the history of Yonex racquets
*1
, this ASTROX model, traditionally hollow inside, uses graphite material in the core, resulting in an 11.8%
*1
reduction in air resistance. By making the shaft solid, resilience is increased, further allowing strong continuous shots.
ASTROX 100 ZX: Extra Slim and Rexis Shaft
Rexis is a high-performance shaft precisely designed through an advanced molding technique with High-Quality, ingenuitive, Performance Graphite material. It has surpassed Yonex’s quality standards.
5.
Revolutionary New Graphite Namd
By utilizing high quality Namd graphite throughout the shaft and frame of both models more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.
Viktor AXELSEN (Denmark), CHOU Tien Chen (Taiwan), Akane YAMAGUCHI (Japan) and other #TeamYonex athletes will make their debut using the new ASTROX 100 ZZ during the 2020 season.

The ASTROX series are distinguished by the
Rotational Generator System
, our intricate weight distribution technology designed with the counterbalance theory that allows head-heavy racquets to recover faster between shots. By employing the VOLUME CUT RESIN, the new 88 S/D models have a further refined Rotational Generator System where intricate weight distribution can be taken to the next level.
Improvements*1 from the VOLUME CUT RESIN can also be seen in the frame and grommets.  The frame structure is evolved with a larger sweet spot made possible by the strength-reinforced Isometric head shape. The grommets are improved with a new pattern that uses larger, strategically-placed grommets, a technology that allows more string movement at impact and ultimately increasing shuttle hold for assertive shot-making. The 88 S models, designed for front-court players, will have longer shuttle hold for precise net control and the 88 D models, designed for back-court players, will balance repulsion and shuttle hold for maximum power.
The ASTROX 88 S PRO and ASTROX 88 D PRO are set to debut on court in March by players such as men’s doubles world no.1 Kevin S. Sukamuljo and Marcus F. Gideon, and women’s doubles world no. 2 Yuki Fukushima and Sayaka Hirota*2.
*1 Some technologies are not applied to the TOUR or GAME models.
*2 BWF World Ranking as of Jan. 5, 2021.
Series Overview
Introducing the new ASTROX 88 D racquet with Rotational Generator System. The counter balanced head adapts to each shot, helping you to control the drive and attack the opposition with increased acceleration, steeper angle and power on the smash.
Product Technology
New Frame Design and Racket Length
Making the whole frame flexible allows the“ASTROX 88 S”to hold the shuttlecock for accurate control, while the“ASTROX 88 D” has more flex in the upper part of the frame transmitting maximum power to the shuttlecock to break through the opponents. In addition the overall length of the“88 S” is only 5mm longer, which enhances both accuracy and power while the“88 D” is 10 mm longer to provide powerful attacks.
NANOMETRIC
NANOMETRIC* improves the bonding strength between the carbon fibres enabling us to take racquet shaft construction to another level. By reducing the amount of carbon in the shaft to make it 60%* thinner than a conventional racquet whilst retaining stiffness, YONEX has created a revolutionary lightweight racquet with lightening head speed and control.
*NANOMETRIC is the new material which applies the NANOALLOY
TM
Technology of Toray Industries, Inc.
ISOMETRIC
The square-shaped ISOMETRIC frame shape is designed to keep vertical strings at a similar length, as well as the horizontal strings to produce an expanded sweet spot in all directions.
NEW Grommet Pattern
The single-pass grommet hole construction provides more grommet holes for a more high-performance stringing pattern.
SOLID FEEL CORE
The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact. Solid feel core is carried in all racquets manufactured in Japan.
AERO+BOX Frame
Combines solid hitting feel and quick swing.
NEW Built-in T-Joint
‘NEW’ Built-in T-Joint is manufactured from a special lightweight plastic combined with epoxy resin and foaming agent that enhances quality and performance by increasing the stability of the shuttle on the string bed and through the air.
NEW Energy Boost Cap
The new shape allows the shaft to flex, which ensures the maximum effect of “Namd
[1]
(more flex and faster kick-back graphite material)” and stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft twisting, increasing control

Product Details:
TK-F Enhanced Edition inherits the three main features of the first generation: the [ANTI-TORSION] that comes with a stable and elastic slim shaft, the[TRI-FORMATION] that enables the frame to make each swing smoother, and a unique shape of the racket head that creates a larger and longer sweet spot to concentrate the force and enable direct and comfortable hitting experience.
TK-F Enhanced Edition is engineered with the well-received [FREE CORE] synthetic handle technology to highlight its incredible performance with an excellent elasticity and comfortable handling experience; the [REBOUND SHIELD] that incorporates the highly durable glass fiber into the multi-layered frame reinforces the elasticity and feedback when hitting; the shaft, which is like the “core muscle” of the racket, is upgraded to a 6.5mm anti-torsion slim shaft with [ANTI-TORSION] technology, which is 4 times stronger and offers a more direct hitting feedback to enable stable and accurate attack.
TK-F Enhanced Edition is all in matt black and delivers a sense of nobility. The rose gold on the lateral side of the frame and the glossy and matt golden watermark sticker together add another touch of luxury.
Product Technology:
The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life.
PYROFIL carbon fiber and its composites, are advanced high-performance materials from Japan.  The characteristic of high intensity bounds ultra-light offers racket excellent shock-absorption and enhances control.
Inspired by military helicopter, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimize material size, reinforce handling feel and performance at a critical standard.
The shaft is key to power transmission, and that's why VICTOR has been committed to developing better shafts.  Through the combination of highly resilient materials and innovative design, VICTOR has created the best shaft ever with incredible anti-torsion performance and resilience.

BADMINTON RACKET TECHNOLOGIES:
WING STABILZER
Introducing aviation technology to control the racket frame. After impact, Li-Ning rackets absorb unnecessary shaking from vibrations and restore the racket’s outer “wings” back to a precision performance mode. This readies the player for a quick, precise and stable follow up stroke.
MPCF REINFORCING TECHNOLOGY
Li-Ning takes the extra step to avoid imperfections sometimes caused by machine processing of other rackets. By implementing multi-layer carbon fibers, the racket is crafted with strength and longevity in mind.
DYNAMIC-OPTIMUM FRAME
Li-Ning rackets are manufactured with a sweet spot that extends upward. The hitting point is moved higher, providing a larger defensive area. This considerably improves hitting velocity due to a wider stringed area and increased bounce strength.
AEROTEC-BEAM SYSTEM
Implementing real data compiled from the field, Li-Ning manufactures the most aerodynamic rackets possible. Advanced calculations have resulted in rackets with extremely low drag and higher intensity.
TB NANO
The nanometer technology combines the carbon fiber and resin more closely. This method provides better elasticity, stability and durability – resulting in more powerful striking.
HIGH TENSILE SLIM SHAFT
Your shot placement will be more accurate with this Li-Ning 7.0 mm diameter slim shaft design. This craftsmanship helps balance the power of rebounds by channeling it into your torsion performance.

INNOVATION
Common technologies throughout the ASTROX 100 series.
1. Expanded Sweet Spot in Modified Frame
Compared to regular round frames, Yonex’s original ISOMETRIC frame creates a wider sweet spot. The ASTROX 100 frame has been slightly modified into an even more square-like shape, increasing the already wide sweet spot by 2.9%
*1
, while maintaining the same overall frame size. Benefits of this evolved ISOMETRIC shape include increased power on strong and continuous shots even if they don’t hit the center of the racquet.
2. Newly Designed Cap: E.B.CAP PLUS
A new structure reduces shaft twisting and increases its flexibility. Thumb fitting shape transmits even more power to the shuttle.
Differences between the ASTROX 100 ZZ and the ASTROX 100 ZX models.
3. Advanced Rotational Generator System
The new innovative Rotational Generator System precisely distributes weight to the top of the frame, joints, and the end of the racquet grip.
In ASTROX 100 ZZ, Black Micro Core material at the top of the frame increases rigidity by 4% and vibration absorption by 2%
*1
. While the use of Black Micro Core material puts more weight on the head of the frame. A new built-in T-joint, which is 1.3%
*1
lighter than any other Yonex racquet, allows the racquet to have a lower weight distribution. By redesigning the racquet’s weight distribution in this manner, high rotational power needed for strong continuous smashes is generated.
4. Improved Swing-ability and Resilience: Slim Shaft
ASTROX 100 ZZ : Hyper Slim Shaft
Designed with the slimmest shaft in the history of Yonex racquets
*1
, this ASTROX model, traditionally hollow inside, uses graphite material in the core, resulting in an 11.8%
*1
reduction in air resistance. By making the shaft solid, resilience is increased, further allowing strong continuous shots.
ASTROX 100 ZX: Extra Slim and Rexis Shaft
Rexis is a high-performance shaft precisely designed through an advanced molding technique with High-Quality, ingenuitive, Performance Graphite material. It has surpassed Yonex’s quality standards.
5.
Revolutionary New Graphite Namd
By utilizing high quality Namd graphite throughout the shaft and frame of both models more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.
Viktor AXELSEN (Denmark), CHOU Tien Chen (Taiwan), Akane YAMAGUCHI (Japan) and other #TeamYonex athletes will make their debut using the new ASTROX 100 ZZ during the 2020 season.

BADMINTON RACKET TECHNOLOGIES:
WING STABILIZER
Introducing aviation technology to control the racket frame. After impact, Li-Ning rackets absorb unnecessary shaking from vibrations and restore the racket’s outer “wings” back to a precision performance mode. This readies the player for a quick, precise and stable follow up stroke.
MPCF REINFORCING TECHNOLOGY
Li-Ning takes the extra step to avoid imperfections sometimes caused by machine processing of other rackets. By implementing multi-layer carbon fibers, the racket is crafted with strength and longevity in mind.
DYNAMIC-OPTIMUM FRAME
DLi-Ning rackets are manufactured with a sweet spot that extends upward. The hitting point is moved higher, providing a larger defensive area. This considerably improves hitting velocity due to a wider stringed area and increased bounce strength.
AEROTEC-BEAM SYSTEM
Implementing real data compiled from the field, Li-Ning manufactures the most aerodynamic rackets possible. Advanced calculations have resulted in rackets with extremely low drag and higher intensity.
TB NANO
The nanometer technology combines the carbon fiber and resin more closely. This method provides better elasticity, stability and durability – resulting in more powerful striking.
STABILIZED ELASTIC SHAFT
We filled the slim shafts of our rackets with the same aramid fibers found in helmets. These heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers provide world-class flexibility and durability. This is another way Li-Ning helps avoid sports injuries.
HOT MELT
Our proprietary process thoroughly mixes resins with carbon fibers to ensure all our rackets are manufactured in a uniform manner. This provides optimum strength and consistent performance no matter which racket you choose.
CUBIC LOCKING
These slim-grooved grommets lock in and protect the exposed portion of the string along the edges of the racket. They help provide shock absorption to make your shots even more accurate.
STABILIZED TORSION ANGLE
With a Stabilized Torsion Angle, shots that are not hit with the sweet spot of the racket are designed to act almost as if they were. This torsion resistance performance allows the frame to remain stabilized for an even hitting surface.
